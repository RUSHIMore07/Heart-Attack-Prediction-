This project harnesses machine learning to predict the risk of heart attacks based on individual health data. By identifying high-risk individuals early, this model aims to enable timely medical interventions that could save lives.

Key Features:

Predictive Power: Uses historical health data to accurately predict the likelihood of a heart attack.
Machine Learning Algorithm: Utilized robust classification techniques that balance precision and recall, as evident in the detailed classification report:
Precision: High precision rates (0.89 for class 0 and 0.88 for class 1) indicate the model's reliability in identifying true positives.
Recall: Strong recall scores (0.86 for class 0 and 0.91 for class 1) highlight its capability to capture the majority of relevant cases.
F1-Score: Balanced F1-scores (0.88 for class 0 and 0.89 for class 1) reflect the model's consistent performance across both classes.

Explainable AI with LIME: To ensure transparency and trustworthiness in healthcare applications, I integrated LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain predictions. This tool helps illuminate why the model predicts certain individuals to be at higher risk, making AI decisions transparent and understandable for healthcare providers.

OpenAI Integration using GPT-4: Incorporated OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 to handle complex natural language processing tasks, such as interpreting medical notes and providing detailed, understandable explanations of the model's findings to healthcare professionals.
